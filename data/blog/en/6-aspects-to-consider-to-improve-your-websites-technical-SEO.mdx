# 6 aspects to consider to improve your website's technical SEO.

When I started working at my current company, one of the first things I worked on to improve was SEO.
I never imagined that it was a long painful task back then, and I am pretty sure my team leader never imagined it too.

**Technical SEO** refers to the behind-the-scenes optimizations that help search engines understand and index a website.
It's a crucial aspect of search engine optimization, as it helps **improve a website's visibility and ranking in search engine results pages (SERPs).**
This is achieved through a variety of techniques, including improving the site's speed and performance, ensuring that it is mobile-friendly,
and making sure that it is easy for search engine bots to crawl and index the website's content.

## 1. Site structure and architecture.

Site structure and architecture. A technical SEO audit will look at your website's structure and architecture to ensure
that it is easy for search engine crawlers to navigate and index your pages.
In my case, I improved SEO statistics by eliminating unnecessary url depths in terms of url structure.
For example, the url path for the product page was `/product/detail/{productId}`.
The page for `/product/detail`, didn't even exist and it was a 404 page.
I just eliminated the url depth `/detail` and set the product page's url path to simply : `/product/{productId}`.
In addition, it includes things like, the organization of your content into logical categories and subcategories,
and the use of breadcrumb navigation to help users and search engines understand the hierarchy of your pages.

## 2. Appropriate use of HTML tags

It is important to use appropriate tags and titles on the website. This includes the title tag,
which appears in the tab of the browser, and the meta description, which appears in search results.
These tags should be descriptive and relevant to the content of the page and not to have any duplicate content among your site's content.
Also, it is important to have high-quality, unique content on the website. This includes having well-written and informative articles,
as well as ensuring that the content is relevant to the website's target audience.

## 3. Page speed and performance

The speed and performance of your website are important factors in user experience and search engine rankings.
A technical SEO audit will look at things like page load times, server response times, and the use of caching
and other performance-enhancing techniques to ensure that your website is fast and efficient.
Some ways to improve website speed, includes optimizing images, minifying code, and using a content delivery network(CDN).

## 4. Mobile-friendliness

More and more users are accessing the web from mobile devices, so it's essential that your website is optimized for mobile.
A technical SEO audit will look at things like the design and layout of your website on mobile devices, the use of responsive design,
and the implementation of mobile-friendly features like click-to-call buttons and location maps.
Google has a tool called Mobile-Friendly Test that can help you determine if your website is mobile-friendly.

## 5. Security and privacy

Ensuring the security and privacy of your website and its users is essential for building trust and credibility.
This is especially important for e-commerce websites because it helps protect sensitive information such as credit card numbers and personal data.
A secure connection is indicated by the presence of "https" at the beginning of the URL, rather than "http."

## 6. Monitoring

Wokring months with SEO, I realized one thing. SEO doesn't stand for Search Engine Optimization, it stands for, Suffering Endless Optimization.
It's important to regularly monitor the technical SEO of your website.
This includes checking for broken links, ensuring that the website is mobile-friendly,
and monitoring the website's speed. By regularly monitoring the technical aspects of your website,
you can identify and fix any issues that may be negatively impacting your search engine visibility.
When one does not have full control of a website it is really important to monitor the SEO statistics regularly.
