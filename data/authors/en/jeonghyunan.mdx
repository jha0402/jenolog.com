Hi you can call me John.

I am a frontend developer and develop web services using React and Typescript.

I have work experience mainly in the ecommerce industry and I strive to develop while keeping in mind the management of service quality, stability, scalability, and development productivity.

I am currently interested in the frontend devops and the frontend architecture such as micro-frontends.
